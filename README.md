# AWS CDK Examples

A collection of AWS CDK code samples crafted in TypeScript, featured on my blog at https://towardsthecloud.com/blog

<!-- TIP-LIST:START -->
> [!TIP]
> **Stop AWS bill surprises from happening.**
>
> Most infrastructure changes look harmless until you see next month's AWS bill. [CloudBurn](https://cloudburn.io) prevents this by analyzing the cost impact of your AWS CDK changes directly in GitHub pull requests, catching expensive mistakes during code review when fixes are quick, not weeks later when they're costly and risky.

> <summary>💰 <strong>Set it up once, then never be surprised by AWS costs again</strong></summary>
> <br/>
>
> 1. **First install the free [CDK Diff PR Commenter GitHub Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/aws-cdk-diff-pr-commenter)** in your repository where you build your AWS CDK infrastructure
> 2. **Then install the [CloudBurn GitHub App](https://github.com/marketplace/cloudburn-io)** on the same repository
>
> **What happens now:**
>
> Whenever you open a PR with infrastructure changes, the GitHub Action comments with your CDK diff analysis. CloudBurn reads that diff and automatically adds a separate comment with a detailed cost report showing:
> - **Monthly cost impact** – Will this change increase or decrease your AWS bill? By how much?
> - **Per-resource breakdown** – See exactly which resources are driving costs (old vs. new monthly costs)
> - **Region-aware pricing** – We pick the right AWS pricing based on the region where your infrastructure is deployed
>
> Your team can now validate cost impact alongside infrastructure changes during code review. Essentially, this shifts FinOps left where you optimize costs as you code, not weeks later when context is lost and production adjustments require more time and carry added risk.
>
> CloudBurn will be free during beta. After launch, a free Community plan (1 repository with unlimited users) will always be available.

## How to run the code from the examples

To run a Typescript example, execute the following:

```

$ cdk deploy
```

Then, to dispose of the stack/s afterwards

```
$ cdk destroy
```
